# Grommet Starter - New App

Welcome :tada:! Thanks for your interest in starting fresh with Grommet, we are thrilled to have you on board.

[Deploy preview](https://deploy-preview-43--peppy-mooncake-22f850.netlify.app/) of the finished app.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have node.js and a package manager; either npm (npm is installed with node.js) or yarn package manager. Create react app can be installed globally or locally using npx (npx comes with npm 5.2+).

[Node Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - The latest LTS version will have node.js, npm, and npx.  
[Create React App Local Install](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) - Instructions to install it locally can be found here (npm versions 5.2+).  
[Create React App Global Install](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f) - Not Recommended - Instructions to install it globally can be found here (npm versions 5.1 or earlier).  
[Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) - Not Required.

## Getting Started

We are going to leverage and install the awesome [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/). We will call it CRA from now on.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

CRA will automatically install dependencies for you. It uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as a package manager behind the scenes. If you prefer to use NPM for your package management, you can delete the `yarn.lock` file and run `npm install` manually.

```bash
rm -rf yarn.lock
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```

Or if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

You should see the CRA landing page. They keep updating it, but it will look something like this:

## Cleaning Up

We like a clean house. Let's first remove the modules and components we are not going to be using for this exercise.

Remove these files from the 'src' directory:

- `src/App.css`
- `src/App.test.js`
- `src/index.css`
- `src/logo.svg`

Inside `src/index.js`, remove the import of `index.css`.

```diff
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
- import './index.css';
import App from './App';
```

Inside `src/App.js`, remove the logo and the import of `app.css`

```diff
- import logo from './logo.svg';
- import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
-        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You should see a beautiful, mostly black and white (accessible), landing page :smile:.

`src/App.js` is the only module in this example (to keep things simple). All the steps from here on will just assume you are inside `src/App.js`.

## Adding Grommet

To add grommet you first need to install our packages

```bash
npm install grommet grommet-icons styled-components --save
```

Or if you are using yarn:

```bash
yarn add grommet grommet-icons styled-components --save
```

You can now add the import of the `Grommet` component to the `App.js` file.

```diff
+ import { Grommet } from 'grommet';
```

Typically, you should include Grommet only once as one of your top-level nodes.

Let's replace the main `div` with `Grommet`.

```diff
- <div className="App">
+ <Grommet full>
  <header className="App-header">
    <p>
      Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
    </p>
    <a
      className="App-link"
      href="https://reactjs.org"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Learn React
    </a>
  </header>
+ </Grommet>
- </div>
```

You will notice no visible change resulted from including Grommet.
Everything in Grommet is self-contained with very minimal global settings.

You might be asking, 'Why do you include it if nothing is changing?'
The answer is simple: Although not strictly required,
we recommend you add `Grommet` from day one, so that you can customize it
in the future by using a `theme`.

Let's now add a custom font-family, font-size, and line-height.

Below the `import` statements, let's add an initial theme declaration:

```javascript
const theme = {
  global: {
    font: {
      family: "Roboto",
      size: "18px",
      height: "20px",
    },
  },
};
```

And modify the Grommet tag with our new theme:

```javascript
<Grommet theme={theme} full>
```

This theme will propagate to all components under this given `Grommet` instance.

FYI. To access Roboto you need to include the font-face. Let's update `public/index.html` to include the font and fix some browser defaults.

```diff
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    ...
+   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500" />
    <title>React App</title>
+   <style type="text/css">
+     body {
+       margin: 0;
+     }
+   </style>
  </head>
```

Look at your updated landing page, and you should see that the font-size and font-family are properly applied.

Good job, you just completed an important step in your Grommet journey.

## Understanding Box

[Box] is an abstraction over [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), and it is very likely you will be using it very frequently in your Grommet app.

[Box] is the main building block container for Grommet. There are also Grommet
components that in essence are just Box components with a few initial props
defined. For example the [Header], [Footer], and [Card] components are built using `Box`
and can accept any props that `Box` can. The benefit of using components like
`Header` and `Footer` is Grommet takes care of some of the work for you by
pre-defining some props.

To start off we are going to use the `Header` and `Text` components in our app.
Let's go the the `App.js` file and import them:

```diff
- import { Grommet } from 'grommet';
+ import { Grommet, Header, Text } from 'grommet';
```

We like to keep our imports in alphabetical order :smile:.

Let's create an AppBar component and replace the `header` tag with it.

```diff
+const AppBar = (props) => (
+ <Header
+   background="brand"
+   pad={{ left: "medium", right: "small", vertical: "small" }}
+   elevation="medium"
+   {...props}
+ />
+);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Grommet theme={theme}>
-     <header className="App-header">
-       <p>
-         Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
-       </p>
-       <a
-         className="App-link"
-         href="https://reactjs.org"
-         target="_blank"
-         rel="noopener noreferrer"
-       >
-         Learn React
-       </a>
-     </header>
+     <AppBar>
+       <Text size="large">My App</Text>
+     </AppBar>
    </Grommet>
  );
}
```

AppBar is just a Box with `row` direction. Children are justified `between` (a space will be added in between them). We add an `elevation` to simulate the same box-shadow from the original example.

Look at your browser again. You should see the AppBar with the `brand` background and some elevation.

With Grommet it is very easy to apply custom brand colors. The place to change colors is in the theme object as you might have already guessed.

```diff
const theme = {
  global: {
+   colors: {
+     brand: '#228BE6',
+   },
    font: {
      family: 'Roboto',
      size: '18px',
      height: '20px',
    },
  },
};
```

The AppBar now has a different color. You can create colors with any name; `brand` was just an example.
Another great Grommet feature is the ability to easily declare context-aware colors which automatically
adapt to light and dark themes. That is, any color can have two variations: `dark` and `light`. For
example, use a light text color in a dark background, and vice-versa. We have created this
[codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/213mry1mnj) with more details on color usage.

For more information on the theme checkout the [theme wiki page](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/wiki/Grommet-v2-theming-documentation).

## Adding Page, PageContent, and PageHeader

Now that we have an AppBar setup let's add the [Page], [PageContent], and [PageHeader] components into our App.

```diff
- import { Grommet, Header, Text } from 'grommet';
+ import { Grommet, Header, Page, PageContent, PageHeader, Text } from 'grommet';
```

```diff
<Grommet theme={theme} full>
+ <Page>
    <AppBar>
      <Text size="large">My App</Text>
    </AppBar>
+   <PageContent>
+     <PageHeader title="Welcome to Grommet!" />
+   </PageContent>
+ </Page>
</Grommet>
```

Page is a helpful container for providing consistent layout across pages in an application. Page and
PageContent work together to ensure horizontal alignment, max-width, and responsive behaviors are
applied in a consistent, turnkey manner.

Notice that the AppBar is not a child of PageContent. This allows the AppBar to stretch across the full
width of the screen without being constrained by the max-width of the PageContent.

## Adding React State

Everything is so static here. Let's add some state. We are going to add a button to the
AppBar to switch between light and dark modes.

We need to import [useState] from React and grab some icons from the [grommet-icons] library.

```diff
- import React from "react";
+ import React, { useState } from "react";
- import { Grommet, Header, Page, PageContent, PageHeader, Text } from 'grommet';
+ import {
+   Button,
+   Grommet,
+   Header,
+   Page,
+   PageContent,
+   PageHeader,
+   Text,
+ } from "grommet";
+ import { Moon, Sun } from "grommet-icons";
```

Let's make this a little easier to read for you and your future co-workers by breaking
the long import statement down to one component per line.
You may want to consider using [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to auto format for you (Tip: you may want to change prettier config default to prettier.singleQuote: true).

```diff
const App = () => {
+ const [dark, setDark] = useState(false);
+
  return (
-   <Grommet theme={theme} full>
+   <Grommet theme={theme} full themeMode={dark ? "dark" : "light"}>
      <Page>
        <AppBar>
          <Text size="large">My App</Text>
+         <Button
+           a11yTitle={dark ? "Switch to Light Mode" : "Switch to Dark Mode"}
+           icon={dark ? <Moon /> : <Sun />}
+           onClick={() => setDark(!dark)}
+         />
        </AppBar>
...
```

We are just leveraging React state by creating a `dark` flag initially set to false.
Once we click the theme mode toggle button, we toggle the `dark` state. The button then switches the theme between 'dark' and 'light'.

Notice that switching between light and dark mode isn't currently causing any changes.
This is because our current theme doesn't have anything specified for dark mode. Lets
merge our custom theme with the grommet theme so that we can see what a theme looks like
when it is setup for dark mode.

First we need to import the `deepMerge` function that will allow us to combine two
grommet themes. We will also need to import the grommet theme.

```diff
import {
  Button,
  Grommet,
+ grommet,
  Header,
  Page,
  PageContent,
  PageHeader,
  Text,
} from "grommet";
+ import { deepMerge } from "grommet/utils";
```

Now lets adjust our custom theme.

```diff
- const theme = {
+ const theme = deepMerge(grommet, {
  global: {
    colors: {
      brand: "#228BE6",
    },
    font: {
      family: "Roboto",
      size: "14px",
      height: "20px",
    },
  },
+ });
- };
```

Now when we toggle our dark and light button we should see some changes.

## Add Tip

The purpose of our light/dark toggle button may not be obvious just from the icons.
Let's add a [Tip] to the `Button` that gives some additional guidance.

```diff
import {
+ Box,
  Button,
  Grommet,
  grommet,
  Header,
  Page,
  PageContent,
  PageHeader,
  Text,
} from "grommet";
```

```diff
<Button
  a11yTitle={dark ? "Switch to Light Mode" : "Switch to Dark Mode"}
  icon={dark ? <Moon /> : <Sun />}
  onClick={() => setDark(!dark)}
+  tip={{
+    content: (
+      <Box
+        pad="small"
+        round="small"
+        background={dark ? "dark-1" : "light-3"}
+      >
+        {dark ? "Switch to Light Mode" : "Switch to Dark Mode"}
+      </Box>
+    ),
+    plain: true,
+  }}
/>
```

Now when we hover over the Button it will give us more info on what the Button does.

## Add Grid and Cards

Let's add some more content to our App. We will need to add the following components:

```diff
import {
  Box,
  Button,
+ Card,
+ CardHeader,
+ CardBody,
+ CardFooter,
+ Grid,
  Grommet,
  grommet,
  Header,
+ Heading,
  Page,
  PageContent,
  PageHeader,
+ Paragraph,
  Text,
} from "grommet";
```

Let's create a CardTemplate component.

```diff
+ const CardTemplate = ({ title }) => {
+   return (
+     <Card>
+       <CardHeader pad="medium">
+         <Heading level={2} margin="none">
+           {title}
+         </Heading>
+       </CardHeader>
+       <CardBody pad="medium">
+         <Paragraph>
+           Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas
+           porttitor non nulla ac vehicula. Aliquam erat volutpat. Mauris auctor
+           faucibus est at mattis. Aliquam a enim ac nisi aliquam consectetur et
+           ac velit. Mauris ut imperdiet libero.
+         </Paragraph>
+       </CardBody>
+       <CardFooter pad="medium" background="background-contrast">
+         Footer
+       </CardFooter>
+     </Card>
+   );
+ };
```

Now let's add some cards to the `PageContent` within the App.

```diff
<PageContent>
  <PageHeader title="Welcome to Grommet!" />
+ <CardTemplate title={"Card 1"} />
+ <CardTemplate title={"Card 2"} />
+ <CardTemplate title={"Card 3"} />
</PageContent>
```

Our App now contains some Cards but they looks a little strange stretching across the
entire Page. Let's organize our Cards within a [Grid].

```diff
<PageContent>
  <PageHeader title="Welcome to Grommet!" />
+ <Grid columns="medium" gap="large" pad={{ bottom: "large" }}>
    <CardTemplate title={"Card 1"} />
    <CardTemplate title={"Card 2"} />
    <CardTemplate title={"Card 3"} />
+ </Grid>
</PageContent>
```

Now that are Cards are contained within a Grid, they sit nicely side by side.

## Making it responsive

If you adjust the size of the browser window, not ice that Grommet is taking care of a
lot of the responsive behavior for us.

On a small screen (around the size of most mobile devices) the content within the cards gets to be a bit long. Let's change the text content in the c=Cards so that it truncates
after 3 lines when we are in a small viewport.

First we need to import [ResponsiveContext](https://v2.grommet.io/responsivecontext).

```diff
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardBody,
  CardFooter,
  Grid,
  Grommet,
  grommet,
  Header,
  Heading,
  Page,
  PageContent,
  PageHeader,
  Paragraph,
+ ResponsiveContext,
  Text,
} from "grommet";
```

Now let's change CardTemplate to use `ResponsiveContext`. `ResponsiveContext` uses [react context api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) behind the scenes.

```diff
const CardTemplate = ({ title }) => {
+ const size = useContext(ResponsiveContext);
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader pad="medium">
        <Heading level={2} margin="none">
          {title}
        </Heading>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody pad="medium">
-       <Paragraph>
+       <Paragraph maxLines={size === "small" ? 3 : undefined}>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas
          porttitor non nulla ac vehicula. Aliquam erat volutpat. Mauris auctor
          faucibus est at mattis. Aliquam a enim ac nisi aliquam consectetur et
          ac velit. Mauris ut imperdiet libero.
        </Paragraph>
      </CardBody>
      <CardFooter pad="medium" background="background-contrast">
        Footer
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

Now when you view the page with a narrow viewport the Paragraph content in the Cards will be truncated at 3 lines.

Well, let's celebrate because now we have a responsive Grommet app, thanks for hanging with us until now.

## Final Considerations

We will keep updating this starter page with more steps. The latest completed version of this exercise is available in this repo in the `master` branch.

Grommet can co-exist with other frameworks. We will never add global styles that will affect your existing components. Although the reverse is not true. By helping other teams migrate to Grommet, we have identified a common problem: global CSS modifiers affecting Grommet components. Whenever you see something weird, try to [reproduce](https://codesandbox.io/s/m7mml8l0zj) it outside your application environment.

If you are able to reproduce it, be nice, file an [issue](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/issues/new).
If you cannot reproduce it, inspect your elements, and you will probably find some global CSS applying unexpected overly opinionated changes to our components. As always, you can join our [Slack](https://slackin.grommet.io) and share your pain with us.

Finally, here are some additional pointers to keep you engaged:

1. [Using Grommet in an existing app tutorial](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-starter-existing-app)
2. [Grommet Storybook](https://storybook.grommet.io) - a lot of examples on how to use our components. Most of them are not real app scenarios though. They are there to illustrate our different props.
3. [Grommet Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grommet/grommet-sandbox) - more friendly when you want to edit and play with the examples, also does not have real app scenarios.
4. [Grommet Site](https://github.com/grommet/grommet-site) - resources and documentation for Grommet components can be found here.
